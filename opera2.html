            <h3><span class="blan">Blan.:</span></h3>       I should command here — I was born to rule,
               But do I rule?  I don't.  Why?  I don't know.
               I shall some day.  Not yet, I bide my time.
               I once was Some One — and the Was Will Be.
               The Present as we speak becomes the Past,
               The Past repeats itself, and so is Future!
               This sounds involved.  It's not.  It's right enough.

        <h3><span class="blan">Blan.:</span></h3>         Come mighty Must!
                          Inevitable Shall!
                    In thee I trust.
                          Time weaves my coronal!
                    Go, mocking Is!
                          Go, disappointing Was!
                    That I am this
                          Ye are the cursed cause!
                          Ye are the cursed cause!
                    Yet humble second shall be first,
                          I wean
                    And dead and buried be the curst
                          Has Been!

                    Oh, weak Might Be!
                          Oh, May, Might, Could, Would, Should!
                    How pow'rless ye
                          For evil or for good!
                    In ev'ry sense
                          Your moods I cheerless call.
                    Whate'er your tense
                          Ye are imperfect all.
                    Ye have deceiv'd the trust I've shown
                          In ye!
                    Ye have deceiv'd the trust I've shown
                          In ye!
                          I've shown in ye!
                    Away! The Mighty Must alone
                          Shall be!

                          We are safe so far,
                    After scaling
                    Fence and paling,

 <h3><span class="blan">Blan.:</span></h3>           We learnt that prickly cactus
