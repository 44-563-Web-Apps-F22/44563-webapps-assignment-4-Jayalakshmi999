<h3><span class="blan">Blan.:</span> </h3>    Attention, ladies, while I read to you
            The Princess Ida's list of punishments.
            The first is Sacharissa.  She's expelled!
        </br>

<h3><span class="all">All:</span> </h3>        Expelled!
</br>

<h3><span class="blan">Blan.:</span> </h3>                 Expelled, because although she knew
            No man of any kind may pass our walls,
            She dared to bring a set of chessmen here!
        </br>

<h3><span class="sach">Sach.:</span></h3>      <p class="directions">(Crying)</p>  I meant no harm; they're only men of wood!
</br>

<h3><span class="blan">Blan.:</span></h3>      They're men with whom you give each other mate,
            And that's enough!  The next is Chloe.
        </br>

<h3><span class="all">All:</span> </h3>                                                     Ah!
</br>

<h3><span class="blan">Blan.:</span></h3>       Chloe will lose three terms, for yesterday,
            When looking through her drawing-book, I found
            A sketch of a perambulator!
        </br>
<h3><span class="all">All:</span></h3> <p class="directions">(Horrified)<</p>                                     Oh!
</br>
<h3><span class="blan">Blan.:</span></h3>      Double perambulator...
</br>
<h3><span class="all">All:</span></h3>        Oh, oh!
</br>

  <h3><span class="blan">Blan.:</span></h3>                           ...shameless girl!
               That's all at present.  Now, attention, pray;
               Your Principal the Princess comes to give
               Her usual inaugural address
               To those young ladies who joined yesterday.

                          "Mighty maiden with a mission"

  <h3><span class="girls">Girls:</span></h3>           Mighty maiden with a mission,
                          Paragon of common sense,
                    Running fount of erudition,
                          Miracle of eloquence,
                        </br>
<h3><span class="blan">Blan.:</span></h3>  We are blind and we
  would see;
</br>
  <h3><span class="all">All:</span> </h3>            We are bound, and would be free;
</br>

  <h3><span class="girls">Girls:</span></h3>            We are dumb, and we would talk;
                    We are lame, and we would walk.
