        <h6>Act 2 : Gardens of Castle Adamant<br />

            back of the stage, crossed by a rustic bridge.  Castle
            Adamant in the distance.

        <P>Girl Graduates discovered seated at the feet of Lady
            Psyche</P></br>
            <p>
Blanche:     Attention, ladies, while I read to you
            The Princess Ida's list of punishments.
            The first is Sacharissa.  She's expelled!
        </br></br>

All:         Expelled!
</br></br>

Blan.:                  Expelled, because although she knew
            No man of any kind may pass our walls,
            She dared to bring a set of chessmen here!
        </br></br>

Sach.:       (Crying)  I meant no harm; they're only men of wood!
</br></br>

Blan.:       They're men with whom you give each other mate,
            And that's enough!  The next is Chloe.
        </br></br>

Chloe:                                                      Ah!
</br></br>

Blan.:       Chloe will lose three terms, for yesterday,
            When looking through her drawing-book, I found
            A sketch of a perambulator!
        </br></br>
All: (Horrified)                                      Oh!
</br></br>
Blan.:       Double perambulator...
</br></br>
All:         Oh, oh!
</br></br>

  Blan.:                           ...shameless girl!
               That's all at present.  Now, attention, pray;
               Your Principal the Princess comes to give
               Her usual inaugural address
               To those young ladies who joined yesterday.

                                  CHORUS OF GIRLS
                          "Mighty maiden with a mission"
                        </br></br>

  Girls:            Mighty maiden with a mission,
                          Paragon of common sense,
                    Running fount of erudition,
                          Miracle of eloquence,
                        </br></br>
                                          Altos:  We are blind and we
  would see;
</br></br>
  Sops:             We are bound, and would be free;
</br></br>

  Girls:            We are dumb, and we would talk;
                    We are lame, and we would walk.
