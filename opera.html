            Psyche</P></br>
Blanche:     Attention, ladies, while I read to you
            The Princess Ida's list of punishments.
            The first is Sacharissa.  She's expelled!
        </br>

All:         Expelled!
</br>

Blan.:                  Expelled, because although she knew
            No man of any kind may pass our walls,
            She dared to bring a set of chessmen here!
        </br>

Sach.:       (Crying)  I meant no harm; they're only men of wood!
</br>

Blan.:       They're men with whom you give each other mate,
            And that's enough!  The next is Chloe.
        </br>

Chloe:                                                      Ah!
</br>

Blan.:       Chloe will lose three terms, for yesterday,
            When looking through her drawing-book, I found
            A sketch of a perambulator!
        </br>
All: (Horrified)                                      Oh!
</br>
Blan.:       Double perambulator...
